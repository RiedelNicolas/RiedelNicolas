## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm NicolÃ¡s, a software developer based in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

**I have experience working across the entire stack, using multiple technologies and programming languages**.

In the present, I am working primarly with Typescript, ReactJS, React Native and NodeJS, but I'm always open to use what is necessary to get the job done.

Additionally, I teach at **Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA)**, where I am completing my final courses in **Software Engineering**.
